#  Python Data Structures: Linked List

## Overview
This repository contains a clean, academic implementation of a **Singly Linked List** in Python. 
The goal of this project is to demonstrate understanding of low-level memory management, pointer manipulation, and algorithmic efficiency without relying on built-in dynamic arrays.

## Key Features
- **Insertion:** At beginning, end, and specific positions.
- **Deletion:** By value or position.
- **Traversal:** Efficient iteration through nodes.
- **Search:** Linear search implementation.

## Time Complexity (Big O)
| Operation | Complexity | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Access**| O(n)       | Linear time required to traverse. |
| **Search**| O(n)       | Worst-case scenario requires scanning the full list. |
| **Insert**| O(1)       | Constant time (at the head). |
| **Delete**| O(1)       | Constant time (if pointer is known). |

## Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Concepts:** OOP, Data Structures, Algorithms.
